**eHack** is a pocketâ€‘sized, multiâ€‘band penetrationâ€‘testing toolkit powered by a **RaspberryÂ PiÂ Pico**,  
a **CC1101** subâ€‘GHz transceiver, an **NRF24L01+** 2.4â€¯GHz radio, a **PN532** RFID/NFC frontâ€‘end,  
and a 128â€¯Ã—â€¯64Â OLED display.  
Everything is written for the Arduino framework and built with **PlatformIO** for fast recompiles and easy hacking.

| &nbsp; | Bands&nbsp;/&nbsp;Tech | What you can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Subâ€‘GHz (315â€¯â€“â€¯915Â MHz)** | CC1101 | â€¢ Live spectrum scan<br>â€¢ CaptureÂ & replay OOK/ASK 433â€¯MHz packets (RCSwitchâ€‘style)<br>â€¢ GateÂ / Barrier toolkit (capture, replay, bruteâ€‘force **CAME** & **NICE** codes)<br>â€¢ **Tesla** chargeâ€‘port opener<br>â€¢ Wideâ€‘band noise jammer |
| **2.4Â GHz** | NRF24L01+ | â€¢ Channelâ€‘map spectrum viewer<br>â€¢ Jammers: Allâ€¯/ Wiâ€‘Fiâ€‘onlyâ€¯/ BTâ€‘onlyâ€¯/ BLEâ€‘only<br>â€¢ BLE advertising spammer |
| **Infraâ€‘Red** | IR LEDÂ + receiver | â€¢ CaptureÂ & replay NEC/RC5/Samsungâ€¦<br>â€¢ Builtâ€‘in bruteâ€‘force tables for TVs & projectors |
| **RFIDÂ /Â NFC** | PN532 | â€¢ Read, emulate, and write 13.56â€¯MHz (MIFARE / NFCâ€‘A) tags |
| **Games** | â€” | FallingÂ Dots, Snake, FlappyÂ Bird |
| **Qualityâ€‘ofâ€‘Life** | â€” | OLED UI with 3â€‘button navigation â€¢ vibration feedback â€¢ battery monitor â€¢ autoâ€‘dimming â€¢ settings saved to EEPROM |
